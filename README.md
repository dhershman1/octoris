This will hopefully some day soon be my envisioning of a proper functional http framework.

Check out the notes folder for markdown files containing ideas and thought processes.

## Current Phase: Planning/POC

(POC: Proof of Concept)

This repo is still in the planning and theory phases! So obviously you shouldn't be using it literally anywhere yet!

## Goal

The goal with octoris is to be both a functional framework and also have no "Magic" happening, no magic strings, or functions, etc. We want you to use the functions and know exactly what is happening when you use that function. We want you to be able to back track and know what is happening with whatever you send that function.

## Testing

Finally! Some POC Code is being added! Currently you can do the following (After you clone the repo and `npm i` in the directory)

All of these commands are ran with `debug` for output logging

- `npm run route` - This will give you a nice log of an example route map built by `octoris`
- `npm run core` - This will run the core of `octoris` with example route maps allows for the test of route builds
- More coming soon!
